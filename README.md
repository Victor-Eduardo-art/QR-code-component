## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

i relearned how to reinforce an element vertically with flexbox, in addition to my knowledge of flexbox.

```css
body {
   height: 100vh;
   display: flex;
   flex-direction: column;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get better at the semantics of HTML5 as well as practice more flexbox.

for example:

```html

<div class="main">
    <h3>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
</div>

```

in this part I was in doubt about which title tag I should use, thinking of a real page I decided to use the <h3>
